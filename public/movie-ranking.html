<h3>Movie #1701</h3>
<p>Yes, a generically numbered movie. It shows numbers and an infinite tunnel of bronze frames. Critics were extremely mixed on this, from "complete masterpiece" to "absurdly boring trash".</p>

<h3>Jack's Stalk</h3>
<p>Even after watching the movie, the viewers question what the title is trying to imply when the movie itself was showing something completely unrelated. And no, it was rated E for everyone.</p>

<h3>Orange Blue Magenta</h3>
<p>A parody on "The Powerpuff Girls", but it shows three hipsters raiding farms in style. This movie is two hours long; but of the three raids in this movie, the second one lasted for an hour and twenty minutes.</p>
